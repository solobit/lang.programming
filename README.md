### CoffeeScript

* [CoffeeScript][cs]: is a programming language that transcompiles to
  JavaScript. The language adds syntactic sugar inspired by Ruby, Python and
  Haskell[1] to enhance JavaScript's brevity and readability, and add more
  sophisticated features like list comprehension and pattern matching.
  CoffeeScript compiles predictably to JavaScript and programs can be written
  with less code, typically 1/3 fewer lines, with no effect on runtime
  performance.

#### Dialects

* [IcedCoffeeScript][02] is a superset of CoffeeScript. The iced interpreter is
  a drop-in replacement for the standard coffee interpreter; it will interpret
  almost all existing CoffeeScript programs. IcedCoffeeScript (ICS) adds two
  new keywords: await and defer. These additions simply and powerfully
  streamline asynchronous control flow, both on the server and on the browser.
  It's selectively running code through a continuation-passing style
  conversion.
